"""
A Great Dane turned Python environment detective
================================================

A lightweight toolset to easily report your Python environment's package
versions and hardware resources.

History
-------
The scooby reporting is derived from the versioning-scripts created by Dieter
Werthmüller for ``empymod``, ``emg3d``, and the ``SimPEG`` framework
(https://empymod.github.io; https://simpeg.xyz). It was heavily inspired by
``ipynbtools.py`` from ``qutip`` (https://github.com/qutip) and
``watermark.py`` from https://github.com/rasbt/watermark.
